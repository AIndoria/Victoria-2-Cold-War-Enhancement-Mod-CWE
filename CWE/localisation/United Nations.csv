EVT_1412086_NAME;$YEAR$ UN Secretary-General Selection;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT_1412086_DESC;Article 97 of the United Nations Charter determines that the Secretary-General is "appointed by the General Assembly upon the recommendation of the Security Council." As the recommendation must come from the Security Council, any of the five permanent members of the Council can veto a nomination. Most Secretaries-General are compromise candidates from middle powers and have little prior fame. Unofficial qualifications for the job have been set by precedent in previous selections, and the appointee may not be a citizen of any of the Security Council's five permanent members. The Secretary-General is customarily appointed for a five-year term, although the length of the term is discretionary.;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;
