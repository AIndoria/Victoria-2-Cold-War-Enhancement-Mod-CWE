coexistence_pledge_desc;World revolution is the Marxist concept of overthrowing capitalism in all countries through the conscious revolutionary action of the organized working class. These revolutions would not necessarily occur simultaneously, but where and when local conditions allowed a revolutionary party to successfully replace bourgeois ownership and rule, and install a workers' state based on social ownership of the means of production. In most Marxist schools, such as Trotskyism, the essentially international character of the class struggle and the necessity of global scope are critical elements and a chief explanation of the failure of socialism in one country.\n\n§YRenouncing World Revolution is thus a vital pre-requisite to starting detente§W;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;

cultural_outreach_desc;Exchange Programs from the United States played a vital role during the Cold War with the Soviet Union. George Kennan, a key figure in the Cold War known as the father of containment, viewed culture as a way to decrease negative sentiments between countries. Examples of cultural exchange programs between the United States and the Soviet Union include theater, museum, and opera expositions. Although not political on the surface, cultural exchanges like these helped alleviate tensions and "humanise" the West in the eyes of the Soviets who witnessed them.;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;

space_meeting_desc;In October 1970, Soviet Academy of Sciences president Mstislav Keldysh responded to NASA Administrator Thomas O. Paine’s letter proposing a cooperative space mission, and there was subsequently a meeting to discuss technical details. By January 12, U.S. President Richard Nixon's Foreign Policy Adviser Henry Kissinger enthusiastically espoused plans for the mission, and expressed these views to NASA administrator George M. Low: "As long as you stick to space, do anything you want to do. You are free to commit--in fact, I want you to tell your counterparts in Moscow that the President has sent you on this mission." By April 1972, both the United States and the USSR signed an Agreement Concerning Cooperation in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space for Peaceful Purposes, committing both the USSR and the United States to the launch of the Apollo–Soyuz Test Project in 1975.;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;

research_partnership_desc;Technology transfer, is the process of transferring technology from the places and in groups of its origination to wider distribution among more people and places. It occurs along various axes: among universities, from universities to businesses, from large businesses to smaller ones, from governments to businesses, across borders, both formally and informally, and both openly and surreptitiously. Often it occurs by concerted effort to share skills, knowledge, technologies, methods of manufacturing, samples of manufacturing, and facilities among governments or universities and other institutions to ensure that scientific and technological developments are accessible to a wider range of users who can then further develop and exploit the technology into new products, processes, applications, materials, or services.

The three nuclear powers made notable progress in the late 1970s, agreeing to terms on a ban on all testing, including a temporary prohibition on PNEs, but continued disagreements over the compliance mechanisms led to an end to negotiations ahead of Ronald Reagan's inauguration as President in 1981. In 1985, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev announced a unilateral testing moratorium, and in December 1986, Reagan reaffirmed US commitment to pursue the long-term goal of a comprehensive test ban. In November 1987, negotiations on a test ban restarted, followed by a joint US-Soviet program to research underground-test detection in December 1987.;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The Soviet Union also expressed its desire to join other international economic organisations and establish contacts with other regional groups. A major step in this direction occurred in 1988 when the Soviet Union signed a normalisation agreement with the EEC. The Soviet government, however, professed no interest in joining the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Although Soviet officials claimed that the international monetary system "was not managed properly," it is more likely that IMF and World Bank regulations were the obstacles: both institutions required that members' currencies be freely convertible and that members provide accurate information concerning gold sales and economic performance.;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVT_8023420_NAME;End of the World Revolution;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT_8023420_DESC;One of the main sticking points in the Cominform was what kind of relations to have with capitalist countries. Though we know the communist system is the one of the future, and these states are tools to control the masses and doomed to fail, they may have things we need. Such as guns. Or food. Anyway, it seems $FROMCOUNTRY$ has resolved this question for all - the capitalist order will fall of its own accord, and the immediate goal is to coexist. While this is technically revisionism, perhaps it is true that Marx could not have foreseen the atom bomb. Still, though this is not the first such instance, questioning the foundation of our ideology may be unwise.;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVT_8023425_DESC;$FROMCOUNTRY$ and their "enemy" have reached an apalling agreement - to open borders to emigration and immigration with each other and all capitalist nations. Although we had, of course, heard about our bloc's loosening of tentions and abandonment of the world revolution, there was no way of knowing it would come to this. Not only are they pressuring us to do the same, but they are flying in the face of everything socialism means! How are we expected to establish a stateless society without impermeable borders?!;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;
